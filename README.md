# FAITHCONNECT
Easier management for churches

## Introduction 
### The Project
Faithconnect is a web based application with inspiration from the creator's own church activities and experiences. In recent times the use of technology to make activities easier has permeated every field and the church shouldn't be any different. With growing church communities, Faithconnect was built to make the management of church information and activities easier. With a dashboard showing church population and upcoming events and activities, church administrators have an overview of basic church information. They application allows them to also input member information, events, announcements,  attendance and offertory for various days. The warehouse of this information summarised into an easy to read interface gives the administrators a good overview of the welfare of the church.
