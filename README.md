# FAITHCONNECT
Make managing your church information simple and easy

## Introduction 
### The Project
Faithconnect is a web based application with inspiration from the creator's own church activities and experiences. In recent times the use of technology to make activities easier has permeated every field and the church shouldn't be any different. With growing church communities, Faithconnect was built to make the management of church information and activities easier. With a dashboard showing church population and upcoming events and activities, church administrators have an overview of basic church information. They application allows them to also input member information, events, announcements,  attendance and offertory for various days. The warehouse of this information summarised into an easy to read interface gives the administrators a good overview of the welfare of the church.

### React framework
React with TypeScript was used for thsi project. React was chosen for its component-based architecture, syntax, and ability to facilitate rapid development and maintainability. TypeScript was utilized for its static typing capabilities, enhancing code quality, scalability, productivity by catching errors during the development process.

### Vite
Vite was selected as the build tool for its fast development server, hot module replacement, and efficient bundling process.

### Supabase
The backend for this project is a Supabase backend. It provided all the functionality needed to develop this project. The main usage here was the database. The relational database structure makes it simpe to use.
